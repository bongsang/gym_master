# Bongsang's Gym Master
This package includes both of RL algorithms and OpenAI's gym so that it is pretty simple to use.


You don't need to install anything.
 > <del> git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git </del><br>
 > <del> cd gym </del><br>
 > <del> pip install -e . </del>

Simply use it.
 
 > python train.py
 
 
I hope my package will be helpful for accelerating your skills to master Deep RL.

Thanks
